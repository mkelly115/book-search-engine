The purpose of this project was to refactor code to allow the use of graphql, queries, and mutations to save users, new users, and associated saved books to a db. A user will be able to search the API for various books and then save them to their user account for later reference. This will be handled by the graphQl and API.

## Usage

On development end,a user will first run NPM I to install all relevant dependencies, next a user will run npm run develop and this will open up both the vite webpage and the graphql server. From there the web page can be accessed to create a new user or login to an existing user. A signed in or created user will have the ability to save books for later reference.

## Conclusion

This project challenged me in many ways as I worked through the process of refactoring code by truly understanding what it does as well as the entire process of creating and assigning functioning JWTs. The process is an arduous one but helps to make me understand data structures in a much more complete way. The App itself is run with graphQl and an apollo server.
